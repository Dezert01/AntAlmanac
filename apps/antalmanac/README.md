## Libraries and reasons we use them

### [MUI](https://mui.com)
It's a popular library based on the decent looking [Material Design](https://m3.material.io)
specification and a significant amount of community support.

The learning curve isn't too high, and developers can rely on the great variety of
prebuilt components.

### [React Big Calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar)
Relatively straightforward way of getting calendar integration with React.

### [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US)
Charts built for React.

### [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)
Free way to get started with interactive maps without having to pay upfront for API access.

### [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)
Literally any state management solution is better than using event emitters.
